    In this program, we first define the URL of the JSON file that we want to download, and the path to the local file where we want to save it.

We then create a URL object for the file URL and open a connection to the server
 using the HttpURLConnection class.
 We set the request method to GET to download the file.

We then read the file contents from the server response and save them to the local
 file using a FileOutputStream.
 Finally, we disconnect from the server and print a message indicating
 that the JSON file has been downloaded and saved to the local file.
